# IceTemple

Unity Course implementation of Breakout or Arkanoid

## Game Design Document

Clone of Old School Breakout/Arkanoid game.

The player is a member of a small village outside of the ice kingdom, which has been taken over the by the ice demon lords.
The only way to save the ice world is to destroy the demon ice king himself.

Each level is essentially a boss fight. You fight the demon lord who has over taken the ice castle by using your magical shield
that is imbued with the powers of fire (called the Tide), that will destroy the many ice gems that power each ice lord. Each 
demon lord has the strange power of warping space-time. Your death is when the demon lord reflects the power back to you and you do not block it with your shield.
